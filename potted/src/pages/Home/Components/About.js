        Indoor plants look great but they can also improve the air quality in your home. Some people say
        that they can even improve your physical and mental health. It can seem daunting to take on
        living things in your home, but it doesn&#39;t have to be! Let the Potted team help you find plants that
        fit your needs, whether that be pet safe, low light tolerant, low maintenance, and more.

        Potted, PGH was born out of a shared passion of its two founders. In the process of filling their
        own homes with houseplants, they garnered a lot of knowledge about what plants can work best
        in certain situations. Now, they want to share their joy and knowledge of houseplants with you!
